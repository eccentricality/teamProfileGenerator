# Team Profile Generator

User can run 'npm test' from terminal to test 4 different classes: employee, manager, engineer, and intern. User can run inquirer via 'node index.js' and answer the series of prompts to create a manager. Once the manager is created the user is provided an option to add an intern or an engineer to his/her team. If chosen intern, user would plug in same information as manager, except instead of phone number you would input the intern's school. If chosen engineer, then instead of phone number user would input engineer's github username. The emails and github user links are linked to tomail for email and the engineer's github profile page for github. User cannot exit the prompts upon manager's creation and must create at least one intern or engineer before being provided the option to exit.

## Lessons Learned

Initial outlook seemed daunting as this was a tougher node project than the readme generator, but again, once I took things step by step it was easier to digest and untangle the task that needed to be completed. CSS was more challenging at times, but even returning to that aspect was not nearly as bad as it used to be. Live demo helped to test everything, and finalizing with test cases with jest helped solidify the final product.
